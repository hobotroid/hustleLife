# hustleLife
A simple Node.js version of [Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), with a Hustle spin.

### Possible Improvements
1. Input could just be a flat array, which would allow iteration over cells to happen at somewhere around O(2n) and in single passes.
2. Iteration could be "smarter", which would allow for cleaner neighbor checks with less conditions.
3. Input could be taken from an external source, or possibly randomized
4. I could further utilize the [Terminal Kit](https://github.com/cronvel/terminal-kit) library to show a nice graphical representation of the generational changes.

Thanks for your time!
